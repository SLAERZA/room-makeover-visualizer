# Capstone: Step Five - Polish Application

## Estimated Time: 20-25 Hours

Focuses on refinement. Clean up UI, finalize stretch features, write solid tests, and ensures code is clean and well-documented.

## Checklist for Step Five

### 1. Review React App Design

-Revisit **component hierarchy**
-Where does the **state live** (global vs local)?
-Could I defend my design decisions to another developer?
-Are all components modular and **easily testable**?

### 2. Finish Stretch Goals

-Add any remaining featuresor imporovements you outlined earlier.
-Examples:
    -Chat features
    -Real-time collaboration
    -Mobile-responsiveness or a React Native version

### 5. Deploy the Application

-Make it live using:
    - **Vercel** (frontend)
    - **Render** or **Heroku** (backend)
-Test Deployed version thoroughly
-Include deployed link in the README

### 6. Refractor for Clarity

-Look for:
    - Repeated patterns
    - Deeply nested conditionals
    - Long functions/components
-Apply:
    - DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
    - Separation of concerns

### 7. Comment Code

-Explain complex logic
-Document edge-case handling
-Leave dev notes where needed

### 8. Push Final Changes to GitHub

-Include:
    - Code
    - Tests
    - Updated `README.md`
    - Documentation or notes

### Submit work
